# ComfyUI SUPIR upscaler wrapper node

## WORK IN PROGRESS

# Installing
Either manager and install from git, or clone this repo to custom_nodes and run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

or if you use portable (run this in ComfyUI_windows_portable -folder):

`python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-SUPIR\requirements.txt`

Pytorch version should be pretty new too, latest stable (2.2.1) works.

`xformers` is automatically detected and enabled if found, but it's not necessary, in some cases it can be a bit faster though:

`pip install -U xformers --no-dependencies`  (for portable `python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -U xformers --no-dependencies` )

Get the SUPIR model(s) from the original links below, they are loaded from the normal `ComfyUI/models/checkpoints` -folder
In addition you need an SDXL model, they are loaded from the same folder.

I have not included llava in this, but you can input any captions to the node and thus use anything you want to generate them, or just don't, seems to work great even without.

Memory requirements are directly related to the input image resolution, the "scale_by" in the node simply scales the input, you can leave it at 1.0 and size your input with any other node as well. In my testing I was able to run 512x512 to 1024x1024 with a 10GB 3080 GPU, and other tests on 24GB GPU to up 3072x3072. System RAM requirements are also hefty, don't know numbers but I would guess under 32GB is going to have issues, tested with 64GB.

## WARNING: currently downloads 10GB clip model as I didn't figure out a way to use existing ones yet

# Tests
Video upscale test (currently the node does frames one by one from input batch):

#### Models we provided:
* `SUPIR-v0Q`: [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lnefCZhBTeDWijqbj1jIyw?pwd=pjq6), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yELzm5SvAi9e7kPcO_jPp2XkTs4vK6aR?usp=sharing)
    
    Default training settings with paper. High generalization and high image quality in most cases.

* `SUPIR-v0F`: [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1AECN8NjiVuE3hvO8o-Ua6A?pwd=k2uz), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yELzm5SvAi9e7kPcO_jPp2XkTs4vK6aR?usp=sharing)

    Training with light degradation settings. Stage1 encoder of `SUPIR-v0F` remains more details when facing light degradations.
